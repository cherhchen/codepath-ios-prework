# Prework - *Color Me Mine*

Submitted by: **Cheryl Chen**

**Color Me Mine** is an app that allows you to learn a little more about me and see pretty colors by clicking buttons.
It contains a button to change the background to a random color and another button to change the text of my name to a random color.
In addition, there is a switch to toggle between two images that describe my mood 90% of the time.

## Notes

I never had experience with Xcode or Swift, so I was sometimes confused on whether I was doing things right.
For example, when setting up the environment, I did not get the same options shown in the tutorial.
However, I relied on online resources to guide me through setting up and coding in Swift.
