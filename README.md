**Color Me Mine** is an app that allows you to learn a little more about me and see pretty colors by clicking buttons.
It contains a button to change the background to a random color and another button to change the text of my name to a random color.
In addition, there is a switch to toggle between two images that describe my mood 90% of the time.

**App Idea:**
I would like to create an app that involves storing and sharing cooking recipes.
I think that food is an important aspect of people's cultures and lifestyles. 
I want to make an app where you can easily record cooking recipes (in text, image, and video), rank your recipes in a tier list, and share recipes with friends.
Advanced features may include giving personalized recomendations on what you should cook tonight based on the items you have at home or the patterns of meals that you have been cooking.
Users may also discover recipes based on level of difficulty/effort and dietary restrictions.

## Notes

I never had experience with Xcode or Swift, so I was sometimes confused on whether I was doing things right.
For example, when setting up the environment, I did not get the same options shown in the tutorial.
However, I relied on online resources to guide me through setting up and coding in Swift.
